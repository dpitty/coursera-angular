Sanity...

I can put Services (as functions) in other code files which is a huge help for decomposition.
Can I put "$inject" in that file too? I tried moving the $inject for the query service and I didn't see it working
I moved it back. Realized it doesn't work still, but I was only testing with date. I tested with title and it worked. Will the title feature work if $inject is in the other file? time to find out.
Turns out the question has been moot because the parameter names have been the same as the injected names (and we haven't been minimizing). Let's redo that...
Worked when in the main app.js file...
Works when the inject is in the decomposed file!! Yes!
That makes my decomposition so readable.
It seems like $inject is coming from angular.min.js, so it's ok that it's injecting into a decomposed file before reaching app.js. I can work with that.

I moved displayShows to the decomposed file archivequeryservice.js. Have a weird paranoia that things got slower. Would that make any sense? The program looking around a new place for the function? I don't think so....
It's definitely the same amount of time.
